config EXAMPLES_MODULE
	bool "Module Example"
	default n
	depends on MODULE && LIB_BOARDCTL
	select BOARDCTL_OS_SYMTAB
	---help---
		Enable the module example

if EXAMPLES_MODULE

config EXAMPLES_MODULE_BUILTINFS
	bool "Built-in File System"
	default y
	depends on FS_ROMFS && BUILD_FLAT
	---help---
		This example supports a very, non-standard but also very convenient
		way of testing with example using CONFIG_EXAMPLES_MODULE_BUILTINFS.
		If this option is selected, the test modules will be built,
		installed in the module/lib/fsroot, then converted to a built-in
		ROMFS file system.

		When the test runs, it will automatically create the ROMFS block
		device and mount the test modules for testing.

		If this option is not selected, then the modules will be left in
		the fsroot/ directory.  You can then copy them to, say an SD card,
		for testing on the target.

		NOTE: This option can only be used in the FLAT build mode because
		it makes an illegal OS call to ramdisk_register().

if EXAMPLES_MODULE_BUILTINFS

config EXAMPLES_MODULE_DEVMINOR
	int "ROMFS Minor Device Number"
	default 0
	---help---
		The minor device number of the ROMFS block. For example, the N in /dev/ramN.
		Used for registering the RAM block driver that will hold the ROMFS file system
		containing the MODULE executables to be tested.  Default: 0

config EXAMPLES_MODULE_DEVPATH
	string "ROMFS Device Path"
	default "/dev/ram0"
	---help---
		The path to the ROMFS block driver device.  This must match EXAMPLES_MODULE_DEVMINOR.
		Used for registering the RAM block driver that will hold the ROMFS file system
		containing the MODULE executables to be tested.  Default: "/dev/ram0"

endif # EXAMPLES_MODULE_BUILTINFS

if !EXAMPLES_MODULE_BUILTINFS

config EXAMPLES_MODULE_BINDIR
	string "Path to Test Modules"
	default "/mnt/sdcard"
	---help---
		The path to the directory on the mounted volume where the test
		modules can found at runtime.

endif # !EXAMPLES_MODULE_BUILTINFS

config EXAMPLES_MODULE_LIBC
	bool "Link with LIBC"
	default n
	depends on !BUILD_KERNEL && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Link with the C library (and also math library if it was built).
		By default, all undefined symbols must be provided via a symbol
		table.  But if this option is selected, then each MODULE test program
		will link with the SYSCALL library and will interface with the OS
		system calls.  You probably will NOT want this option, however,
		because it will substantially increase the size of code.  For
		example, a separate copy of printf() would be linked with every
		program greatly increasing the total code size.  This option is
		primarily intended only for testing.

		WARNING:  Libc will not be built with -mlong-calls and this may
		result in runtime linking failures due to out-of-range functions
		calls.

config EXAMPLES_MODULE_LIBGCC
	bool "Link with LIBGCC"
	default n
	depends on !BUILD_KERNEL && EXPERIMENTAL
