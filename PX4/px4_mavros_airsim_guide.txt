GUIDE TO RUN ROS AIRSIM MAVROS PX4 IN UNREAL ENGINE:

Reason to do this:
If you want to develop rosnodes to work with px4 and mavros without relying on the extra airsim layer at the end product.
So we want to use airsim to simulate our drone and provide visual sensor information and collision while building your node, but when deploying to drone no airsim dependencies are needed.

Order to start the programs in:
1. MavRos rosnode:
	* roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14540@192.168.1.36:14557"
	* https://docs.px4.io/master/en/simulation/ros_interface.html
2. PX4 SITL:
	* make px4_sitl_default none_iris
	* https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/px4_sitl/
3. Run Unreal envirionment
	* Here we need to wait for everything to connect (This step takes a minut or two)
4. AirSim ros nodes.
