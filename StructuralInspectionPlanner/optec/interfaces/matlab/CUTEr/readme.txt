CUTEr interface for qpOASES

There is currently no native interface for qpOASES in CUTEr. However, the
MATLAB interfaces of CUTEr and qpOASES can be used to solve CUTEr problems with
qpOASES from within MATLAB.

To obtain accurate timings for the CPLEX solvers, you need to compile the
replacement mex file:
$ mex -ldl -lrt cplexlink122.c
You might have to change the number in the filename and in the (short) code if
your version is different than 12.2.

Files:

test_cuter.m:
    Solve one CUTEr problem with qpOASES.

comparison_cuter.m:
    Solve specific problems from cuter_problems.m with different QP solvers and
    save timings and accuracy in folder solver_comparison.

cuter_performance_graph.m:
    Generate performance graph from data generated by comparison_cuter.m.

load_cuter.m: 
    Decode a SIF file and load problem. Needs correct environment variables
    CUTER and MYCUTER, e.g.: 
    CUTER="$HOME/CUTEr/cuter2"
    MYCUTER="$HOME/CUTEr/cuter2/CUTEr.large.pc.lnx.gfo"

cuter_init_problem.m:
    Load matrices by calling CUTEr. Called by load_cuter.

cuter_problems.m: 
    List of some CUTEr problems.

qpresidual.m:
    Compute residual of a QP iterate.
